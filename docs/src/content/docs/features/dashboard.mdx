## Features

### Custom Widgets
Build your own analytics widgets to track the metrics that matter most. Click **Add Widget** to open the widget builder.

Each widget is configured with:
- **Name** — a label displayed on the dashboard
- **Data Source** — choose from messages, contacts, campaigns, transfers, or sessions
- **Metric** — count, sum, or average
- **Display Type** — number card or chart
- **Chart Type** — line, bar, or pie (when display type is chart)
- **Group By** — break down chart data by a field value (when display type is chart)
- **Filters** — narrow results by field conditions (e.g., status equals "failed")
- **Color** — visual accent for the widget
- **Share with team** — make the widget visible to other users in your organization

Widgets can be edited or deleted by their owner using the icons that appear on hover.

### Group By Charts
When creating a chart widget, select a **Group By** field to split the data by distinct values of that field.

| Chart Type | Without Group By | With Group By |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Line** | Single line over time | Multiple lines — one per group value |
| **Bar** | Bars over time | Bars for each group value |
| **Pie** | Slices over time | Slices for each group value |

**Available group-by fields per data source:**
- **Messages** — status, direction, message_type, whatsapp_account
- **Contacts** — whatsapp_account, is_read
- **Campaigns** — status, message_status (aggregates sent/delivered/read/failed counts)
- **Transfers** — status, source
- **Sessions** — status

For example, a pie chart on the **campaigns** data source grouped by **message_status** shows slices for sent, delivered, read, and failed message totals across all campaigns in the selected period.

### Time Range Filters
Filter your metrics by different time ranges:
- **Today** — view metrics for the current day
- **Last 7 days** — week-over-week comparison
- **Last 30 days** — monthly overview
- **This month** — calendar month to date
- **Custom range** — select a specific date range with an interactive calendar

All widgets and dashboard metrics reflect the selected time period. Number widgets also show a percentage change compared to the previous period. Your filter preference is saved locally and persists across sessions.

### Agent Analytics
